Tarn is a simple and flexible roguelike engine written in C that allows you to
completely script the game in embedded Lua, and provides a few simple API
functions to aid you.

REQUIREMENTS
  gcc, libtcod 1.4.0, lua 5.1

DOCUMENTATION
  http://github.com/jdp/tarn/wikis

BUILD NOTES
  You'll need to edit the LIBTCOD variable in the Makefile to point to where
  you unzippled libtcod to. libtcod's Makefile doesn't include a `make install`
  rule, so everything that gets made just stays in that folder. Rather than
  manually copying+pasting, just edit the Tarn Makefile accordingly.
