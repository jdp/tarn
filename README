Tarn is a simple and flexible roguelike engine written in C that allows you to
completely script the game in embedded Lua, and provides a few simple API
functions to aid you.

REQUIREMENTS
gcc, libtcod 1.2, lua 5.1

HOW TO USE
When tarn is started, it first looks for whatever config file CONFIG_SCRIPT is
defined as in tarn.h and executes it. Then it will try to initialize the game
window. After that, it will execute the script defined as START_SCRIPT in
tarn.h. These Lua scripts are not provided, you must write them yourself.
